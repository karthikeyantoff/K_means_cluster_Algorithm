# K-means-Cluster

K-Means_Cluster
🌍 World Development Country Clustering using K-Means

A Machine Learning web application that groups countries into meaningful clusters based on world development indicators such as income, life expectancy, child mortality, and economic factors.
The model is built using the K-Means Clustering algorithm and deployed using Streamlit.

📌 About the Project

This project uses K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to analyze and group countries based on global development indicators.

Unlike supervised learning models, K-Means does not require labeled data. Instead, it identifies hidden patterns and similarities within the dataset by grouping countries with similar characteristics into clusters.

The Streamlit application provides a simple and interactive interface to explore these clusters visually and gain insights into global development trends.

The project is deployed using Streamlit Cloud.
